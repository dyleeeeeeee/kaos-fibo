                    <dd>
                        The ratio of the original data size to the compressed data size. A higher compression ratio
                        indicates more effective compression. Calculated as: Original Size / Compressed Size.
                        For example, a ratio of 2:1 means the compressed data is half the size of the original.

                        A sequence of symbols (usually binary digits) that represents a specific value or character
                        in a coding scheme. In Fibonacci coding, each positive integer has a unique codeword ending
                        in '11'.

                        A collection of related data points or values. In this system, datasets consist of
                        comma-separated positive integers that are compressed using Fibonacci coding.

                    <dd>
                        A character or sequence used to separate data items. In input parsing, commas serve as
                        delimiters between numbers. Prefix-free codes like Fibonacci don't need explicit delimiters
                        between codewords.

                    <dd>
                        The process of converting data from one format to another. In compression, encoding
                        transforms original data into a compressed representation. Decoding reverses this process.

                        In information theory, a measure of the unpredictability or randomness in data.
                        Higher entropy means less redundancy and typically harder to compress. Shannon entropy
                        defines the theoretical limit of lossless compression.

                        compressing positive integer numerical datasets, making it ideal for sensor readings,
                        timestamps, IDs, and similar data.

                        A code where the decoder can recover from errors or dropped data by finding the next
                        valid codeword boundary. Fibonacci coding is self-synchronizing because the '11' terminator
                        uniquely identifies codeword boundaries.
